Andrew Huberman is a very successful podcaster. He generally talks about wellness and health in his podcast, has interesting guests over and has millions of listens on every episode. And he has a great website where you can search for keywords to find corresponding podcast episodes or parts of episodes where he discusses these topics. 

In this video, we will build the first step into making a website like Andwer Huberman's website to find podcast episodes based on keywords. You can replicate this to index any podcast that you like.

With AssemblyAI, this is a very quick process to both implement and to run.
